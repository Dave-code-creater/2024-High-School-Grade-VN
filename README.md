# High School Graduation Examination Analysis (Vietnam 2023-2024)

## Overview
Each year, 12th-grade students in Vietnam participate in one of the most crucial academic tests of their educational journeyâ€”the High School Graduation Examination. These results play a significant role in determining university admissions, as many prestigious universities in Vietnam rely on these grades to evaluate student profiles. This R project provides insights into the structure and outcomes of this important test.

## Test Structure
Students are required to take exams in three compulsory subjects:
1. **Math**
2. **Literature (Vietnamese)**
3. **Foreign Languages**: Students can choose from a range of languages, including English, Russian, Korean, German, French, and Cantonese.


## Language Participation Breakdown
One of the questions that arise is: **What percentage of students take each foreign language exam?**

> **Note:** The `Other` category includes students who did not take any foreign language exam, likely due to exemptions such as IELTS certification. According to [IELTS Asia](https://www.ieltsasia.org/), *"IELTS is accepted in Vietnam as evidence of English language proficiency for university applications, both at the undergraduate and postgraduate levels."* Many universities accepted IELTS results during the 2023-2024 academic year, leading to a decrease in the number of students taking traditional foreign language exams.

## Key Findings
- **English** dominates with nearly **99%** of participants.
- **Russian** follows at around **0.3%**.
- Other languages, such as **French**, **Cantonese**, **German**, and **Korean**, have significantly smaller participation.

## Challenges and Observations
There is a noticeable bias in the grading of foreign languages. Students from larger cities like Hanoi (where Russian is more commonly taught) and Ho Chi Minh City (where Cantonese is more prevalent) tend to perform better in these languages. Meanwhile, the majority of students across the country take English, which may lead to greater variability in results.

### Literature Performance
The **Literature** exam presents some unique challenges as it is mandatory for all students. Distribution graphs show that grading for this subject follows a bell curve, which suggests that the test is well-designed to differentiate between varying levels of student performance.


## Conclusion
As the data indicates, the distribution of grades for most subjects follows a bell curve, which suggests that the test quality is high and can effectively separate students into distinct performance groups. However, the concentration of students in English-language exams and the smaller sample sizes for other languages may introduce some biases in language performance comparisons.
